  I taught my final course in Fall 2019.
  You can view a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU&t=1329s">video of my last lecture</a>, which was not about computer science.
  <hr>
  Khan Academy now carries <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">algorithms tutorials</a> for which <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~devin">Devin Balkcom</a> and I produced content.
  <hr>
  My newest book is <i>Algorithms Unlocked</i>.
  The Amazon site for the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Unlocked-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262518805/">here</a>,
  and the MIT Press site is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-unlocked">here</a>.
  <p>I maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/au-bugs/bugs-1e.php">errata page</a> for <i>Algorithms Unlocked</i>. If you find an error in the book and it's not already
    in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/au-bugs/bugs-1e.php">errata page</a>
    send email to <a href="algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu">algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu</a>. (The email address in the preface of the book is incorrectâ€”the first known
    error in the book.)</p>
  <p>Algorithms Unlocked is the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/AU-10K.html">10,000th book title published by MIT Press</a>.</p>

  Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in Introduction to Algorithms?
  <p>If you are, then see the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/#solutions">frequently asked question and answer</a> below.</p>
  <p> If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.</p>

  I receive many requests from students outside Dartmouth who
  want to work with me as interns. I do not take interns from outside Dartmouth.
  <hr>
  <p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/">Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric</a>.</p>
  <p>I occasionally teach a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks.
    I publish a <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/Cormen-rules.pdf">list of usage rules </a>that I require my students to observe.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>In 2015, PRI's "The World"
    ran area <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-06-15/women-computer-science-little-mentoring-goes-long-way">story on mentoring women
      in computer science</a> in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>I was interviewed for the Command Line Heroes podcast <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/learning-the-basics">"Learning the BASICs."</a></p>
  <p>You can also hear me spout off in "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDwqQjfehKE">Philosophical Trials #7</a>."</p>

  <h3>Introduction to Algorithm</h3>
  <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary,
    I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</p>
  <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:</p>
  <p class="question">Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</p>
  <p class="answer">We are currently working on the fourth edition. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering whether to hold off buying the third edition in
    anticipation of the fourth edition, I advise you not to wait.</p>
  <p class="question">Where is the website for the book?</p>
  <p class="answer">The MIT Press site is http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms</p>
  <p class="question">Where can I find a list of errata?</p>
  <p class="answer">We maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature,
    allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.</p>
  <p class="question">How do I report errors?</p>
  <p class="answer">First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error,
    send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.</p>
